    <h2>Sump pumps</h2>
    <p>Zoeller is a good name in the sump pump world and the <a href='https://www.zoeller.com/en-na/about/history'>Zoeller Pump Company</a> is headquartered and manufactured in Louisville, KY. Our first March was filled with rain, rain, and more rain. Living right next to a small river, I did not want to take any chances with the basement flooding. We had to bail out the basement with buckets during a power outage. Thankfully my parents are <a href='/assets/images/2018-03-01-basement-upgrades/the-best.gif'>the best</a> and came to the rescue with a Honda gas generator.</p>


    <h2>Radon</h2>
    <p>Radon is . In our area of Michigan, the level of radon in our basement was 11.2pCi/l. To combat this, we installed a <a href='https://www.michigan.gov/deq/0,4561,7-135-3312_4120_4196-485693--,00.html'>radon mitigation system</a>. https://www.familyhandyman.com/smart-homeowner/home-safety-tips/what-is-radon/view-all/

    <h2>Furnace</h2>
    <p>Our furnace is a Janitrol and from what I've learned, it's a gigantic pile of garbage. According to <a href='https://www.furnacecompare.com/manufacturers/janitrol.html'>FurnaceCompare.com</a>, "The Janitrol brand was acquired by Goodman Manufacturing Co., which is owned by Daikin Industries Ltd. Goodman used to market "budget friendly" residential and commercial central air conditioners, furnaces and heat pumps under the Janitrol brand, but has since discontinued use of the Janitrol brand name and has consolidated the Janitrol line under the Goodman brand name instead." I've been told by HVAC professionals that Goodman is also synonymous with garbage.</p>


    <h2>Water Heater</h2>
    <p>Not two weeks after we moved fully moved into the house did the hot water heater die. My dad and I purchased a replacement A.O. Smith 50 gallon water heater w/ a powered vent at Lowe's with a 10% discount coupon.</p>
