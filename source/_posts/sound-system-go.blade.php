    <h2>Record player, speakers, and amp</h2>
    <p>
    We purchased this setup as a Christmas present to our newly married selves back in 2016.

                    <li>Some stupid little brush so I can feel good about cleaning every spec of dust off the records. I don't even know, man.</li>

    <h2>Raspberry Pi's</h2>
    <p>I bought two <a href='https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/'>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</a>'s and loaded a Debian based distro called <a href='https://volumio.org/'>Volumio</a> onto their SD cards.</p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>The first song that we blasted outta this baby was Operation Ivy - Sound System, as you do.
