    <h2>Record player, speakers, and amp</h2>

    <h2>Raspberry Pi's</h2>
    <p>I bought two <a href='https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/'>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</a>'s and loaded a Debian based distro called <a href='https://volumio.org/'>Volumio</a> onto their SD cards.</p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>The first song that we blasted outta this baby was Operation Ivy - Sound System, as you do.

    <h2>Pics!</h2>

            <p class="my-2">This is the temporary home of the second Raspberry Pi located in the barn. It plays slow jazz and hair metal for the barn cats. They love it.</p>
