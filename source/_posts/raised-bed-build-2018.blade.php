    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <p>Building supplies</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Makita drill and impact driver with lithium-ion brushless motor. These things rock.</li>
        <li>A 1980's Craftsman circular saw</li>
        <li>16x 2in. x 12in. x 12ft ground contact boards</li>
        <li>6x 4in. x 4in. x 8ft ground contact posts</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Earth moving tools</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Truper contractor wheelbarrow</li>
        <li>D-handle aluminum scoop shovel for scooping lots of dirt</li>
        <li>Silage pitchfork for scooping lots of mulch</li>
        <li>Bow rake to spread the mulch and dirt around</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Considerations</h2>
    <p>You may be asking yourself, "Why would they choose to use pressure treated ground contact boards? Won't that leach arsenic or other badness into the soil and plants? Why would they feed that food to their family?"</p>
    <ol>
        <li>We are not using CCA treated wood. https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/chromated-arsenicals-cca</li>
        <li>https://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/techniques/raised-bed-lumber-pressure-treated-safe</li>
        <li>https://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/infxtra/infptforraisedgardens.html</li>
        <li>I do not want to rebuild these garden beds in the next 10 years. I figured that if we spent money on higher quality materials rated for ground contact and the elements that we could extend the functional life of our raised garden beds. By my calculations, we need to harvest 468 heads of cauliflower until the project pays for itself.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p>The boxes are constructed with simple <a href='http://www.woodworkbasics.com/butt-joint.html'>butt joints</a> combined with corner posts for extra support.</p>
